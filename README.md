Slimer Script is a script written in Python whose goal is to parse all the files on a hard disk, in order to collect their name, their size, and their last modification date.

These data are then saved as log files, saved locally, and uploaded to a server.

In case of a script execution error, a Trello alert is generated.

## Why I developed Phoenix Down Script ?

Because I'm a man a little paranoid. If one of my many hard drives decides to die, this script probably won't be able to resurrect it, but at least I'll know immediately which files need to be restored.

work in progress...
